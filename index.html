    <h1>Code Challenge</h1>
    <p>Recreate the UI in this video using Vanillajs, HTML, and CSS.</p>
    
    <video width="100%" controls>
      <source src="assets/slider-nav.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>

    <h3>Scenario</h3>
    <p>
      You're building an interactive editorial piece about cities around the world, and want to include a navigation component that will allow the reader to learn about a different city.
      Create a simple, minimalist navigation bar based on the video example and use the JSON file provided. Match the design as closely as you can. The navigation bar should have a sliding bar that indicates a selected item, and that bar should resize itself to match the width of the selected item text.
      <ul>
        <li>On resize, the sliding indicator bar should update its position and size to match text.</li>
        <li>Code should be optimized for Safari. Support for other browsers is not necessary.</li>
        <li>Please limit library/framework usage (Compilers are permissible but No React/Vue,&nbsp;please).</li>
        <li>ES6 and CSS as much as possible. SASS is permissible.</li>
        <li>You will have 24 hours to complete the exercise.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Bonus ⭐ ⭐ ⭐</h3>
    <p>Display the current time of the selected city. You have creative license on how this should look and behave.</p>

    <h2>Finished Navigation Bar</h2>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>review the challenge</li>
      <li>create GitHub repo: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettlyne/cm">https://github.com/brettlyne/cm</a></li>
      <li>set up fonts & document the challenge</li>
      <li>commit and confirm gh-pages works: <a target="_blank" href="https://brettlyne.github.io/cm/">https://brettlyne.github.io/cm/</a></li>
      <li>use a video screenshot to grab color / typography values
        <ul>
          <li>on a real project these would be already available as code presumably</li>
          <li>also had to install SF Pro from Apple's site</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
